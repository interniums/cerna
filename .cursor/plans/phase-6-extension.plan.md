# Phase 6 Plan — Browser Extension (Last)

## Objective

Add quick capture + optional new-tab replacement once the core dashboard is sticky.

## Deliverables

- Extension actions:
- Save URL to current workflow + section
- Create a task with URL attached
- Add URL to essentials
- Optional setting:
- “Replace new tab with Cerna” (opt-in only)

## UX constraints

- No hidden actions; clear confirmations for destructive operations.
- Clear progress states for network calls; prevent double-submits.

## Acceptance criteria
