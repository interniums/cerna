# Phase 5 Plan — Morning Briefing (Non-AI first)

## Objective

Reduce startup friction with a short, actionable briefing that respects user attention.

## Deliverables (non-AI)

- Briefing card (global + per-workflow context) showing:
- tasks due today / overdue
- next meeting time (from calendar integration when available)
- suggested first focus block (simple heuristic)
- Clear states: loading, empty, error.

## Optional later (AI, opt-in)

- AI summary only over user-owned data (tasks + event titles) with explicit consent.
- Never auto-enable; provide transparent “what data is used” microcopy.

## Acceptance criteria
